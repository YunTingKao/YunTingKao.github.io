# Community Sleep Project

This is my Community Sleep Project for course, CAMS-UA 170.

I have created an interactive game written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I didn't publish them online, however, you can simply open them by clicking the HTML file called index.html. The game will then open in the browser.
There is also a screen recording for the game in the following link.
